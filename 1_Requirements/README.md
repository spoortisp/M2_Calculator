.Features of Calculator

          A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
          calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. We begin with writing the software to read the keyboard for input, and display pressed keys on the LCD. Next, we wrote the code which would allow users to enter and edit numbers.  Finally, we wrote the code which would allow user to perform calculations.
